👋 Hi, I’m Vitaliy, a Computer Science student at the University of Illinois-Chicago. I’m passionate about developing efficient software and constantly learning new technologies.

💻 My skills include Python, C, C++, and SQL, with a focus on building full-stack applications.

🌱 I’m currently developing a workout tracker app while diving deeper into backend development and databases.

🔭 I’m also interested in cybersecurity data analysis and its integration into real-world environments.

⚡ Fun fact: Cars are cool 🏎️ — intrested in the computer engineering behind them.
